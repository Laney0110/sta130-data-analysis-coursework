# STA130: Data Analysis Coursework

This repository contains coursework completed for the STA130 course at the University of Toronto, focusing on statistical reasoning and data science using Python.

## Course Overview

STA130 introduces students to the fundamentals of statistical reasoning and data science, emphasizing practical data analysis skills using Python. The course covers data manipulation, visualization, statistical inference, and communication of results.

## Coursework Components

The repository includes the following  s:

- **1**: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebook; basic data types and operations  
- **2**: Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn; understanding distributions  
- **3**: Data wrangling with pandas; transforming and summarizing data  
- **4**: Hypothesis testing; one and two-sample tests  
- **5**: Bootstrap confidence intervals; resampling techniques  
- **6**: Simple linear regression; interpreting model outputs  
- **7**: Multiple linear regression; model selection and diagnostics  
- **8**: Classification methods; decision trees and evaluation metrics  
- **9**: Ethical considerations in data science; study design principles  

## Web Scraping with Python

In addition to the Python-based  s, I independently explored basic web scraping techniques using Python as a supplement to the data collection process. The goal was to extract structured data from publicly available web pages for further analysis.

Key tools and methods used:
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`
- **Tasks performed**:
  - Sending HTTP requests and parsing HTML content
  - Extracting table data and text from specific page elements
  - Converting web content into structured `DataFrame`s for analysis
  - Exporting data into `.csv` format for reuse

This self-initiated component reflects my interest in automating data collection and integrating Python workflows into statistical reasoning tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, requests  
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Notebook
